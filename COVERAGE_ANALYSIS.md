## 📈 Recommendations for Improvement

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)

1. **Add Controller Integration Tests**
   ```csharp
   // Example: Test TaskController actions
   [Test]
   public async Task All_ShouldReturnTasksWithPagination()
   {
       // Arrange, Act, Assert
   }
   ```

2. **Complete SummaryService Testing**
   - Test all dashboard summary calculations
   - Verify data aggregation logic

3. **Add API Controller Tests**
   - Test JSON responses
   - Verify API contracts

### Short-term Goals (1-2 Sprints)
