# Playwright Test Fixes Summary

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Selector Strict Mode Violations**
- **Problem**: Multiple elements found with same selectors
- **Fix**: Made selectors more specific and used `.First` when needed
- **Examples**:
  - `input[name='Input.RememberMe'], input[type='checkbox']` ‚Üí `input[name='Input.RememberMe'][type='checkbox']`
  - `a[href*='Task'], a:has-text('Tasks')` ‚Üí `nav a:has-text('Tasks')`.First

### 2. **Application Connection Issues**
- **Problem**: `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` - Application not running
- **Fix**: Added connection checks and better error messages
- **Solution**: Must start TeamWorkFlow application before running tests

### 3. **Login Detection Issues**
- **Problem**: Tests couldn't detect if user was logged in
- **Fix**: Improved login detection logic with multiple fallback methods
- **Methods**: Check for logout button, user greeting, or URL patterns

### 4. **Timeout Issues**
- **Problem**: Long timeouts waiting for elements that don't exist
- **Fix**: Reduced timeouts and added better error handling
- **Improvement**: Faster failure detection

## üöÄ Quick Test Instructions

### Step 1: Start Your Application
```bash
# In one terminal, start the TeamWorkFlow application
cd TeamWorkFlow
dotnet run
```

### Step 2: Run Connectivity Tests
```bash
# In another terminal, run basic connectivity tests
cd TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests
./run-single-test.ps1 -TestName "Application_ShouldBeAccessible" -Headed
```

### Step 3: Test Login Functionality
```bash
# Test basic login
./run-single-test.ps1 -TestName "BasicLogin_ShouldWork" -Headed
```

### Step 4: Run All Authentication Tests
```bash
# Run all authentication tests
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=AuthenticationTests" -- Playwright.LaunchOptions.Headless=false
```

## üõ† Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. **Element Selectors Need Refinement**
- Some selectors may not match your actual HTML structure
- Need to inspect actual page elements and update selectors accordingly

### 2. **Test Data Setup**
- Tests assume certain data exists in the database
- May need to create test data or modify tests to handle empty states

### 3. **Page Structure Assumptions**
- Tests assume certain page layouts and navigation structures
- May need to adjust based on your actual application design

## üîç Debugging Steps

### 1. **Check Application is Running**
```bash
# Test if application responds
curl -k https://localhost:7015
```

### 2. **Run Tests in Headed Mode**
```bash
# See what's happening in the browser
./run-single-test.ps1 -TestName "LoginPage_ShouldLoadCorrectly" -Headed -Debug
```

### 3. **Check Screenshots**
- Failed tests automatically capture screenshots in `screenshots/` folder
- Review these to see what the page actually looks like

### 4. **Inspect HTML Elements**
- Use browser dev tools to find correct selectors
- Update page object locators to match your actual HTML

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Start your application**: `dotnet run --project TeamWorkFlow`
2. **Run connectivity test**: Verify basic connection works
3. **Check login credentials**: Ensure test users exist in your database
4. **Update selectors**: Modify page objects to match your HTML structure
5. **Run tests incrementally**: Start with simple tests and build up

## üéØ Expected Improvements

- **Faster test execution**: Reduced from 812s to ~60-120s
- **Better error messages**: Clear indication of what's wrong
- **More reliable tests**: Less flaky due to better selectors
- **Easier debugging**: Headed mode and screenshots for troubleshooting

The main issue was that the TeamWorkFlow application wasn't running during the tests. Once you start the application, most tests should work much better! üöÄ
