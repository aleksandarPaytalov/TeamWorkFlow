## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure .NET 6.0 SDK is installed
dotnet --version

# Install Node.js (for Playwright browsers)
# Download from: https://nodejs.org/
```

### 2. Install Playwright

Run the installation script:
```powershell
./install-playwright.ps1
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Build the test project
dotnet build TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/

# Install Playwright CLI
dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.Playwright.CLI

# Install browsers
cd TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests
playwright install
cd ..
```

### 3. Configure Test Settings

Edit `TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "TestSettings": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://localhost:7015",  // Your app URL
    "Timeout": 30000
  },
  "TestUsers": {
    "AdminUser": {
      "Email": "PLACEHOLDER_ADMIN_EMAIL",     // Use environment variables
      "Password": "PLACEHOLDER_ADMIN_PASSWORD"
    },
    "OperatorUser": {
      "Email": "PLACEHOLDER_OPERATOR_EMAIL", // Use environment variables
      "Password": "PLACEHOLDER_OPERATOR_PASSWORD"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Security**: Use environment variables for real credentials. See the security documentation for setup instructions.

### 4. Run Tests

#### Option A: Using the PowerShell Script (Recommended)
```powershell
# Run all tests with report
./TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/run-playwright-tests.ps1

# Run specific tests
./TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/run-playwright-tests.ps1 -TestFilter "AuthenticationTests"

# Run in headed mode (visible browser)
./TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/run-playwright-tests.ps1 -Headed

# Run with specific browser
./TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/run-playwright-tests.ps1 -Browser "firefox"
```

#### Option B: Using dotnet test
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/

# Run specific test class
dotnet test TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/ --filter "ClassName=AuthenticationTests"

# Run with specific browser
dotnet test TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/ -- Playwright.BrowserName=firefox

# Run in headed mode
dotnet test TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/ -- Playwright.LaunchOptions.Headless=false
```

## 📊 Test Reports

After running tests, you'll find:

- **HTML Report**: `TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/playwright-report/index.html`
- **Screenshots**: `TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/screenshots/` (on failures)
- **Videos**: `TeamWorkFlow.PlaywrightTests/test-results/` (on failures)
- **Traces**: For debugging failed tests

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to:

1. **Run unit tests first** (existing)
2. **Run Playwright tests** (new job)
3. **Upload test reports** as artifacts
4. **Upload screenshots** on failures
5. **Support multiple browsers** in parallel

## 🛠 Maintenance & Extension

### Adding New Tests

1. **Create Page Object** in `PageObjects/` directory
2. **Add Test Class** in `Tests/` directory
3. **Update BaseTest.cs** if needed
4. **Run tests locally** before committing

### Best Practices

- ✅ Use Page Object Model pattern
- ✅ Implement proper waits (avoid Thread.Sleep)
- ✅ Use data-testid attributes when possible
- ✅ Test responsive design
- ✅ Validate accessibility features
- ✅ Clean up test data in teardown

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Configure test users** in your application database
2. **Run the installation script** to set up Playwright
3. **Execute a test run** to verify everything works
4. **Customize test data** in appsettings.json
5. **Add more tests** as needed for your specific workflows
