## ðŸ“‹ Task Management

### 1. **Task Dependencies**
Allow tasks to depend on other tasks, preventing work until prerequisites are complete. Implementation would include a dependency selector when creating/editing tasks and visual indicators showing blocked tasks.

### 2. **Task Templates**
Create reusable task templates for common workflows. Users could save current task configurations as templates and select from a template library when creating new tasks.

### 3. **Task Time Tracking**
Add ability to track actual time spent on tasks. Operators could start/stop timers while working, with automatic calculation of total hours and comparison against estimates.

### 4. **Task Comments**
Enable discussion threads on tasks. Team members could post updates, questions, and replies directly on task pages, with notifications for mentioned users.

### 5. **Task Attachments**
Allow file uploads directly to tasks. Users could attach relevant documents, images, and files to tasks with preview capabilities for common file types.

### 6. **Task Notifications**
Email/SMS alerts for task assignments and deadlines. System would send configurable notifications when tasks are assigned, approaching deadline, or overdue.

### 7. **Recurring Tasks**
Schedule tasks that repeat on defined intervals. Users could set daily, weekly, monthly, or custom recurrence patterns with automatic task creation.

### 8. **Task Prioritization System**
Visual indicators for urgent vs. normal tasks. Implementation would include color-coding, sorting options, and priority flags visible in all task views.

### 9. **Task Checklists**
Sub-items within tasks that can be checked off. Tasks could contain multiple checklist items with individual completion tracking and progress indicators.

### 10. **Task History**
Complete audit trail of all changes to a task. System would log all modifications including status changes, assignments, and edits with timestamp and user information.

### 11. **Task Estimation**
Allow setting estimated hours for completion. Users could input expected time requirements with variance ranges and comparison against actual time spent.

### 12. **Task Delegation**
Ability to reassign tasks to other team members. Implementation would include a reassignment interface with operator selection and optional transfer notes.

### 13. **Task Tags**
Custom categorization system for tasks. Users could create and assign multiple tags to tasks for flexible filtering and organization beyond standard categories.

### 14. **Task Approval Workflow**
Multi-step approval process for completed tasks. Define sequential or parallel approval steps with designated approvers and status tracking.

### 15. **Task Burndown Charts**
Visual representation of task completion rate. Interactive charts showing progress over time with trend analysis and completion forecasting.

### 16. **Task Dependencies Visualization**
Network diagram showing relationships between tasks. Interactive graph visualization of task dependencies with critical path highlighting.

### 17. **Task Effort Estimation**
T-shirt sizing or story point system for estimating relative task complexity. Teams could use consistent sizing metrics for better planning.

### 18. **Task Risk Assessment**
Identify and track potential issues that might affect task completion. Include risk probability, impact rating, and mitigation strategies.

### 19. **Task Blocking Issues**
Track specific impediments preventing task progress. Operators could flag blocking issues with descriptions and notification to managers.

### 20. **Task Automation Rules**
Create conditional rules that automatically update task properties. For example, automatically change priority when deadline approaches.
