ðŸ”© Part Management
1. Part Quality Control
Track inspection results and defect rates. Implement structured quality workflows with pass/fail criteria, measurement data, statistical analysis (SPC), and visual defect classification to meet internal and customer quality standards.

2. Part Lifecycle Management
Manage the entire lifecycle of partsâ€”from initial design through production, service, and obsolescence. Enable proactive planning for replacements and compatibility tracking across revisions and assemblies.

3. Part CAD Integration
Maintain direct linkage between inventory items and CAD models. Enable quick access to design drawings, version control, and change history for Engineering Change Notices (ECNs) and Design Reviews.

4. Part Batch & PPAP Compliance Tracking
Support full traceability and documentation for automotive PPAP requirements. Track production batches alongside submission elements like Dimensional Results, Control Plans, Process Flow Diagrams, and Initial Sample Inspection Reports (ISIRs).

5. Advanced Product Quality Planning (APQP) Alignment
Integrate APQP elements with part tracking, ensuring that planning, design FMEAs, validation testing, and production readiness reviews are documented and traceable throughout the project lifecycle.

6. Part Revision & Change Management
Control revisions with full audit trail for each part. Track changes through workflows involving engineering, manufacturing, and quality, including notifications, approvals, and rollback capabilities.

7. Supplier Part Qualification
Manage supplier part submissions, including PPAP documentation, material certifications, and process approvals. Score suppliers based on compliance, quality history, and delivery performance.

8. Part Material & Compliance Records
Maintain records of material specifications, RoHS/REACH compliance, IMDS entries, and material certificates. Link materials to part records to ensure traceability and regulatory compliance.

9. Part Performance Feedback Loop
Capture in-field performance and warranty data. Enable continuous improvement through feedback on part failures, repairs, and root cause analysis linked to specific batches or revisions.

10. Audit & Regulatory Readiness
Ensure readiness for IATF 16949, ISO 9001, and customer audits by maintaining centralized, easily accessible documentation for every part. Include training records, calibration histories, and quality system compliance evidence.
